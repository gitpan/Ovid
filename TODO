TODO list for Ovid.

Items closer to the top will likely be done first.

Replace CPAN module with native functions.

Add support for Module::Build.

Try harder to get module descriptions, copyright, and other metadata. 

Create Bundle dummy packages that simply require component parts

Find solutions to building modules that:

  insist on querying the user for configuration info at build time, causing ovid to hang until the user responds.

  require dependencies to be installed before they'll build. Obviously this make
  sense for some modules, but not all.

  do not list requirements with ExtUtils::MakeMaker and try to figure it out themselves.

Done:
Nicer looking help output.
Change 'loglevel' to more standard 'verbosity'.
Fix IO redirection -- IO redirection removed.
Check for, and skip, installed dependencies. -- done aug 31, 2004
