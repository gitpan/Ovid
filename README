This is the README file for Ovid, which recursively builds CPAN modules and all dependent modules as
RPM files.

Each RPM that Ovid generates lists all its required files so rpm tools like apt-get (the rpm version),
urpm, yum and others can find and install them as dependencies.
Ovid puts an end to manual dependency chasing madness!

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Alternately, if you are on an RPM based system, type the following to build an RPM file:

  rpmbuild -ta Ovid-<version>.tar.gz

For a version 0.01, you would type

  rpmbuild -ta Ovid-0.01.tar.gz

After the RPM is built, type:

  rpm -i /path/to/rpm/file
